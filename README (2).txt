To compile & run this code, first download the hw4compiler.c file and any input files to the same directory. 
Use "gcc hw4compiler.c" to generate a program file from the .c file.

You can now run the program while passing in your input file with this command: "./a.out input_file.txt".
During runtime, if an error is reached, the program will stop, if the error is found in statement the porgram will continue.

The expected output will be shown directly in the terminal, and there is going to be a file created named elf with the input for the VM.

NOTE: My program has a bug where variables that has numbers in it such as 'ans1' will cause the program to stop. Please do not enter a varibale that contains numbers.
